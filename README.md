# Global Retail Data Engineering Case Study

## Overview
This project is a comprehensive data engineering case study aimed at building a data pipeline for the Global Retail industry using Databricks. The project focuses on data ingestion, processing, and visualization to derive insights from retail data.

## Architecture
The architecture consists of several key components:
- Data Sources: Various retail data sources including sales, inventory, and customer data.
- Data Ingestion: Processes for collecting data from different sources.
- Data Processing: Transformation and analysis of data using Databricks.
- Data Storage: Storage solutions for processed data.
- Visualization: Tools for visualizing insights derived from the data.

## Data Sources
The project utilizes the following data sources:
- Sales Data
- Inventory Data
- Customer Data
- External Market Data

## Implementation Layers
The implementation is divided into the following layers:
1. **Data Ingestion Layer**: Responsible for collecting and ingesting data from various sources.
2. **Data Processing Layer**: Involves data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.
3. **Data Storage Layer**: Storage solutions (e.g., Delta Lake) for processed data.
4. **Visualization Layer**: Tools and dashboards for presenting data insights.

## Getting Started
To get started with the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmilioMonteLuna/End-to-End-DE-Global-Retail.git
   ```
2. Set up your Databricks environment.
3. Run the data ingestion scripts to load data into Databricks.
4. Execute the data processing notebooks to transform the data.
5. Use the visualization tools to explore data insights.
